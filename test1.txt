With the development of hardware, concurrent programs become more and more important. The web server handles thousands of requests once. Tablets and mobile apps are rendering user images and performing various computing tasks and web requests at the meeting. Even traditional batch problems -- reading data, computing, writing output -- are now used to hide the I/O's operating latency to make full use of the core of modern computer devices. The performance of the computer is growing linearly each year.
